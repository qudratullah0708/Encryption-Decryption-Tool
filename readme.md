# Simple Encryption and Decryption Script

This is a simple Python script for encrypting and decrypting strings using a basic algorithm. It provides options for encryption, decryption, and exiting the program.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the command `python script_name.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt strings.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypt any string input using a simple algorithm.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt strings that have been encrypted using this script.
- **Randomization:** Utilizes random characters to enhance encryption.
- **User Interaction:** Provides a simple command-line interface for interaction.

## How it Works

- **Encryption:** The script takes a string input, splits it into words, and encrypts each word by adding random characters at the beginning and end, and shifting the first character to the end.
- **Decryption:** To decrypt, it reverses the process by removing the random characters and shifting the last character to the beginning.
